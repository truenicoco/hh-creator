# Poker hand history creator

![](./screenshot.png)

hh-creator is a [PyQt5](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download5)-based
application to create Texas and Omaha Hold'em poker hand histories from scratch,
including a nice looking hand replayer.
Its main use is to make educational poker videos but it can also be used to store
interesting hands that were played live.

It was developed for the French online poker web community
[Kill-Tilt](https://www.kill-tilt.fr/).
